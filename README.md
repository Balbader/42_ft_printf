# Ft_printf

## Introduction
You will discover a popular and versatile C function: printf(). This exercise is a great
opportunity to improve your programming skills. It is of moderate difficulty.
You will discover variadic functions in C.
The key to a successful ft_printf is a well-structured and extensible code.
Once this assignment passed, you will be allowed to add your
ft_printf() to your libft so you can use it in your school C
projects.

## Mandatory part
Description Write a library that contains ft_printf(), a
function that will mimic the original printf()
You have to recode the printf() function from libc.
The prototype of ft_printf() is:<br>
int ft_printf(const char *, ...);<br>
Here are the requirements:
- Donâ€™t implement the buffer management of the original printf().
- Your function has to handle the following conversions: cspdiuxX%
- Your function will be compared against the original printf().
- You must use the command ar to create your library.
Using the libtool command is forbidden.
- Your libftprintf.a has to be created at the root of your repository.

You have to implement the following conversions:
- %c Prints a single character.
- %s Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).
- %p The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format.
- %d Prints a decimal (base 10) number.
- %i Prints an integer in base 10.
- %u Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.
- %x Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.
- %X Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format.
- %% Prints a percent sign.
